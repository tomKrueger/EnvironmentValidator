- Support Environment Release Level
  Release Level is used to specify which set of validations to execute.
  This could be for each release you specify additional tests.
  This could be to specify the set of tests to run against a developer machine by application they are supporting to ensure their machine is ready.

- Support Variables 
  Example <SetVariable Name="AppFolder" Value="c:\Apps" />

- Read config values and store in variables for use in other tests.
  This will allow for reading of a web.config to get settings of an app and then 
  use these values in later running tests to validate those settings.
